## Homebrew
Homebrew... the wonderful way to create your characters to be your own. You may have a homebrew variant of your starting equipment and you may find some other homebrew throughout the adventure. All homebrew must be approved before use. I have a couple of items of homebrew items that I have created that can be used without approval.
