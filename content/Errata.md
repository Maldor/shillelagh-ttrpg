DMs are players with privileges in a campaign, and are also Human... Here are some of the mistakes that the DM has made. This is not for shaming the DM, but more about common mistakes that can be made in the heat of the moment.
# Session 0
- It could have been made clear that Maldor does not operate under the same ruleset that the characters do during the discussion after the roleplay section. This might cause questions later on if Maldor has to be used to prevent a TPK or similar fate.
# Session 1
None
# Session 2
None
# Session 3
- Detect Magic was used  after the disintegration of Orieoth. This should have revealed that the dagger was magically enhanced but the DM said that no magic was emanating from the dagger. Any item with a +1,2 or 3 is considered a magic weapon. The DM was under the impression that it was not a magic weapon AND that Detect Magic could only detect magic that had a school assigned to it (which magically enhanced weapons technically don't)
# Session 4
## Feathergale Spire
- On the approach to Feathergale spire, it should have been noted that their was a flyer in the air circling the spire.
- On the top floor where Thurl was met, there should have been a pair of Giant vultures in addition to the Feathergale Knights. 
- The Drawbridge should have been up, but the PCs would have seen a bell from which to call Savra
- Savra or Thrul should have mentioned the purpose of the feast, but didn't narratively it will make more sense in Session 5
