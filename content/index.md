## Announcing: [[Adventure Hook|Princes of the Apocalypse]]

> [!Summary] About the adventure
> A terrible threat gathers in the North. Throughout this region of the Forgotten Realms, savage marauders bring destruction. Monsters are on the prowl, preying on flocks, rampaging through croplands, and attacking homesteads and travelers. These troubles have a source known to few in the North: Elemental Evil. Servants of this malevolence gather in the Sumber Hills and spy on the Dessarin Valley, drawn by a force they can’t explain. _Princes of the Apocalypse_ presents an epic campaign against the forces of Elemental Evil that can occupy you and your players for many months.

### About the group
Created during a campaign to the northern lands, Shillelagh was a group of 5 Adventures who came together to stop an eternal winter. Who knows where they will go next...

Or what they will be up to...
