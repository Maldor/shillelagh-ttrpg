# Dagan Frebyld
### Player: David
### Backstory:
Dagan Frebyld is the elder brother of Asteljar Frebyld. They hail from Ironslag in the eastern Ice Spire mountains. He was an apprentice rune shaper wizard and very valued slave to the Fire Giants due to his magical skills. Unlike his brother, Dagan was not allowed to go on raids and was often part of the family hostages held high above the giant forges as insurance for the fighter slaves to perform well and also return. When Asteljar's final raiding party did not return, Dagan and the rest of the Frebylds were going to be sacrificed to Surtur. Dagan was able to overcome the magical bonds inhibiting his abilities and transported the family from Ironslag, just moments before their cage reached the molten slag heating the forge. The effort of the rescue damaged his connection to the Weave. He was only able to save some of the spells he had memorized that day into a makeshift spellbook.

Presently, Dagan only has access to magic through his basic connection to Moradin, after swearing off the worship of Surtur he was forced to participate in at Ironslag. Dagan helped the family hide deep in the Ice Spires, away from the Giant clans, but he was convinced his little brother was still alive. He wants to find him and bring the burly fighter to their family's new home and freedom.

Very tall and moderately strong. Heavily scarred on his left side from the fires and magical backlash from escaping the cage. The scars have left him with a pronounced limp and Dagan moves slower than someone of his size would normally.
# Fendra Ahliya
### Player: Brittaneee!
### Backstory
Fendra was born in her family home, the Sanctuary Archive of lost and powerful knowledge. Located deep in a forest of the Feywilds the archive was mostly isolated, and its knowledge guarded for generations by the Ahliya clan.
The archive is sacred, powerful, and alive. It’s sentient, objects tend to appear and disappear in the dwelling based on its mood. Windows and doors open and close on their own. Inhabitants, at times, get a feeling that someone or something is there, often guiding towards or away from something.
Twenty years ago, Fendra’s parents disappeared. She has no idea where they went or why. She was a child when her parents left and the spirts of the surrounding forest and archive raised her. She has little knowledge of the outside world beyond what she has learned from the many books that fill the archive. It was her birthright and duty to stay at the archive. An Alihya must be present to protect the magic. If left unattended for too long, the magic will fail, the sanctuary will die, and all the knowledge it protects is vulnerable.
