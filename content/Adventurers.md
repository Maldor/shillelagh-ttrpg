# Dagan Frebyld
### Player: David
### Backstory:
Dagan Frebyld is the elder brother of Asteljar Frebyld. They hail from Ironslag in the eastern Ice Spire mountains. He was an apprentice rune shaper wizard and very valued slave to the Fire Giants due to his magical skills. Unlike his brother, Dagan was not allowed to go on raids and was often part of the family hostages held high above the giant forges as insurance for the fighter slaves to perform well and also return. When Asteljar's final raiding party did not return, Dagan and the rest of the Frebylds were going to be sacrificed to Surtur. Dagan was able to overcome the magical bonds inhibiting his abilities and transported the family from Ironslag, just moments before their cage reached the molten slag heating the forge. The effort of the rescue damaged his connection to the Weave. He was only able to save some of the spells he had memorized that day into a makeshift spellbook.

Presently, Dagan only has access to magic through his basic connection to Moradin, after swearing off the worship of Surtur he was forced to participate in at Ironslag. Dagan helped the family hide deep in the Ice Spires, away from the Giant clans, but he was convinced his little brother was still alive. He wants to find him and bring the burly fighter to their family's new home and freedom.

Very tall and moderately strong. Heavily scarred on his left side from the fires and magical backlash from escaping the cage. The scars have left him with a pronounced limp and Dagan moves slower than someone of his size would normally.

### Backstory
A fairy wizard who lived most of her life alone in the forest. Socially awkward and likes to collect things (including knowledge of things) because she never had much to her name. Now she likes to collect trinkets and books. Eccentric in a nerdy way.
