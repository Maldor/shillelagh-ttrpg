Quest giver: The Order of the Gauntlet

A convoy has recently gone missing in the area near Summit Hill. Find it or find out why its missing.
To help, the The Order of the Gauntlet has sent a Contact to meet with Vasre and provide more information about the route of the convoy and its purpose.

Contacts information:
"About 2 weeks ago, a delegation from Mirabar disappeared somewhere in the [[Sumber Hills]] on their way to Summit Hall. Best we could tell, they were either waylaid or were lost in the hills. Given how no one has seen or heard anything, the former is more possible. Speaking to a couple of Guards along the route the delegation was taking, I was able to determine that they were at least in the [[Beliard]] before they went missing."
