### Dagan Frebyld
Player: David
Discord: 3eyedfish
Character comments:
- Rune Shaper claims that all three spells need to be selected but the other spells are available after L9 and L17
- Is the brother of Asteljar
- Is deathly afraid of fire in all its forms
- Will be going Wizard after at the second level onwards
Quest proposed:
3 months ago, he started feeling a pull toward the area where the Sumber Hills reside. He was drawn to the allure of power to lend him strength to find his brother and save his family. It was at this moment that the Elder Elemental Eye made a mistake in showing a portion of the future it wanted to bring about. This terrified him greatly and now using this vision he works toward a future where this vision does not occur.
### Fendra Ahliya
Player: Brittaneee!
Discord: brittaneee
Character Comments:
- The book "All the Places and Back" isn't what it seems to be
- Is Book smart not street smart.
- Background has some places to tie into the current adventure. Specifically the last paragraph referencing "Some type of darkness". Will modify that part to suit the narrative a bit.
Quest proposal:
Fendra was recently forced to leave the relative safety of the Archive in order to seek a reason for the gathering darkness. On her way out she picked up a book that she thought and on initial appearances seems to be an inspirational book. The book is semi sentient and upon sensing a darkness and impending doom, opened a portal to the material plane in order to find the source of the problem. Occasionally the book will present mis-capatlized words or words that were not there before as a means of encouragement. One day, the book will send her back to the feywild to resolve the darkness there.
